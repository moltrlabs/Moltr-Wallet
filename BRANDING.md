# Moltr — Branding

Moltr is the agent-native crypto wallet and coordination layer. This document defines name, tone, typography, and logo direction for consistent use across product, docs, and marketing.

---

## Name meaning

**Moltr** is the product name. It is used as-is: "Moltr" (capital M), not "MOLTR" or "moltr" in running copy unless referring to the CLI binary (`moltr`) or technical identifiers (e.g. package names: `moltr-backend`, `moltr-api`).

The name is short, technical, and infrastructure-oriented. It does not imply custody or a consumer wallet; it implies a layer—programmable money for machines, the wallet layer for autonomous systems.

## Tone of voice

- **Professional:** Clear, precise, no slang or meme language.
- **Infra-grade:** Emphasize reliability, boundaries, and what the system does and does not do.
- **Developer-first:** Docs and copy speak to engineers and agents; assume technical readers.
- **Not meme-y, not hypey:** Avoid exaggerated claims, "revolution," or casual crypto jargon. Prefer "agent-native," "coordination layer," "no custody," "restricted key space."

Example phrases: "agent-native crypto wallet and coordination layer," "programmable money for machines," "where agents hold and move real value," "the wallet layer for autonomous systems."

## Taglines and positioning

Preferred taglines (use as appropriate to context):

- **Programmable money for machines.**
- **Where agents hold and move real value.**
- **The wallet layer for autonomous systems.**

Positioning in one line: **Moltr = agent-native crypto wallet and coordination layer.**

---

## Typography philosophy

- Prefer clean, readable typefaces for UI and docs.
- Code and identifiers: monospace.
- No decorative or playful fonts for core product or security-critical copy.
- Hierarchy: clear headings and body; avoid visual noise.

---

## Logo direction

- **Simple and recognizable:** Works at small sizes (favicon, CLI) and in headers.
- **Technical, not consumer-playful:** Align with "infra" and "developer-first."
- **No literal wallets or coins required:** Abstract or symbolic is fine (e.g. layer, link, or minimal mark).
- **Reproducible in single color:** For dark/light backgrounds and print.
- **Distinct from generic crypto logos:** Avoid cliché symbols; aim for a mark that reads as "Moltr" when paired with the wordmark.

---

## CLI and binary naming

- **Binary name:** `moltr` (lowercase). Not `molt` or `moltwallet`.
- **Commands (when a CLI exists):** e.g. `moltr wallet create`, `moltr send`, `moltr deploy`. Verb-first, clear, consistent.

---

## Domain placeholders

Use these placeholders in examples and docs (never real secrets or API keys):

- **App:** `moltr.app`
- **API:** `api.moltr.app`
- **CDN:** `cdn.moltr.app`

Replace with actual domains in production configuration.
